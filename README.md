### Session 1 - Create Sampler & Load sounds
A simple grid (16x16) was made to wire up the sampled sound to each numbered grid. A basic structure for the code was made. In the next session I'd like to experiment with running a sequenced pattern based on the numbered div. 

Basic code structure: Create Sampler & Load sounds --> create beat maker UI ---> execute running code.
